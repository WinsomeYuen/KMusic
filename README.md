# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* To run in comand line type in "rails server"

* Contains MySQL database in project

## Setting up MySQL ##
```
mysql> create database kmusic_development;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> grant all privileges on kmusic_development.* to 'root'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

You can do the same thing for two more databases kmusic_production and kmusic_test.
